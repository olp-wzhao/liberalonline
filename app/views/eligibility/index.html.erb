<h1 class="pagetitle">Eligibility</h1>
<h3>Who Can Contribute</h3>
<p><strong>Under Ontario's Election Finances Act, the Ontario Liberal
Party may only accept contributions from individuals, unions that hold
bargaining rights for Ontario workers, and corporations that carry on
business in Ontario and are not registered charities.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to these legal requirements, the Ontario Liberal Party
does not accept contributions from hospitals, colleges, universities,
municipalities, or from any organization that receives public funding
except as payment for services rendered or goods provided. If you fall
within one of these categories, please do not make a contribution.</p>

<h3>Contribution Limit:</h3>
<p>In each year, any person, corporation or trade union may contribute up
to $9,300 to Ontario Liberal Party. Also, you may contribute up to
$1,240 to any of our constituency association, but the total
contribution to all Ontario liberal constituency associations must not
exceed $6,200. This means the maximum annual political contribution
allowed in a non-election year is $15,500 to each registered party and
its constituency associations. </p>

<p>During an election you may make extra contributions. At
election time, you may give up to an additional $9,300 to Ontario
Liberal Party and up to $1,240 to any Ontario Liberal Party candidate
so long as the total contribution to all Ontario Liberal Party
candidates does not exceed $6,200.</p>
