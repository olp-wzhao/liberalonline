# require 'spec_helper'

# # This spec was generated by rspec-rails when you ran the scaffold generator.
# # It demonstrates how one might use RSpec to specify the controller code that
# # was generated by Rails when you ran the scaffold generator.
# #
# # It assumes that the implementation code is generated by the rails scaffold
# # generator.  If you are using any extension libraries to generate different
# # controller code, this generated spec may or may not pass.
# #
# # It only uses APIs available in rails and/or rspec-rails.  There are a number
# # of tools you can use to make these specs even more expressive, but we're
# # sticking to rails and rspec-rails APIs to keep things simple and stable.
# #
# # Compared to earlier versions of this generator, there is very limited use of
# # stubs and message expectations in this spec.  Stubs are only used when there
# # is no simpler way to get a handle on the object needed for the example.
# # Message expectations are only used when there is no simpler way to specify
# # that an instance is receiving a specific message.
