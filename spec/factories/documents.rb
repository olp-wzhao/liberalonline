    introduction "<p>If you were there, then I'm sure you no doubt agree that it was a great time had by all who were attending. Great food, great company, great Liberals! All the ingredients you need for a recipe for success!!!</p>"
    body "<p>The week kicked off in high spirits, fresh off of a fantastic Holiday Skating Party that featured Dalton &amp; Terri McGuinty, Santa, and a couple of Toronto Maple Leafs greats joining Ontario Liberals for some family fun. For the second time in as many months, Ontario was once again recognized for having one of the world's best education systems.&nbsp; The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) said that key investments in our public education system has enabled students to succeed. UFC officials were also in Toronto on Tuesday to announce that thanks to the McGuinty government, Ontario will host its first MMA event in the New Year.&nbsp; The UFC's Director of Canadian Operations told MMA fans, \"we're very thankful to Premier Dalton McGuinty\". Also this week, Premier McGuinty wrote an op-ed about Ontario's electricity system, made a visit to Polar Mobile to highlight the work of young entrepreneurs and tech start-ups that are booming in Ontario, and Minister Pupatello asked, what exactly has Tim Hudak done this year? And finally, the&nbsp;Premier hosted the inauguaral OPS Toy Drive, which collected a record-breaking 6,500 toys for families in need to be distributed through the Salvation Army this holiday season. PS &ndash; Be sure to check your mailbox this weekend, as the Ontario Sales Tax Transition Benefits payments roll out today!
